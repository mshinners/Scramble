Player:
1. I want to enjoy playing the game and be able to use some strategy to get a high score.
2. I want to understand how to play the game before it begins.
3. I want to know how my score is calculated.
4. I want to know how much time I have to build my word.
5. I want to see how I did in comparison to other players.

Developer:
1. I want to create a fun, visually appealing game using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
2. I want to create a single-player game similar to Scrabble which has elements of chance and strategy.
3. I want to provide the player rules before they begin playing so they understand the game.
4. I want the player to be able to select a single letter tile per round.
5. I want the tiles provided to be a random assortment, with preference given towards vowels.
6. I want different tiles to appear every few seconds.
7. I want the user to be able to deselect a tile if they no longer want to use it.
8. I want the user to be able to clear the upcoming tiles and get new ones to help them get a specific letter.
9. I want to clearly display how much time is left to select a letter and how much time is left in the game.
10. I want to check that the player has submitted a valid, Scramble accepted word (not abbreviations or proper nouns), and let them know the result of the round (their score, if the word was invalid, or if they ran out of time).
11. I want to calculate their score and display it on the scoreboard if it is in the top ten.
